🍎 AR Apple Catcher Game (Built using Meta Spark AR)

This project is an *interactive AR filter game built using **Meta Spark AR**.  
The game uses **face tracking** to control a virtual basket that moves with the player’s head movement. Apples fall from random positions on the screen, and the player must **catch them in the basket** by moving their face.

The game keeps track of the player’s **score** and provides **three lives** before ending, creating an engaging and playful augmented reality experience.

🎯 Features
- 🧠 **Face tracking:** The basket follows the user’s chin movement in real time.  
- 🍏 **Random apple spawns:** Apples fall from different positions to make each game unique.  
- 🪣 **Collision detection:** When the apple hits the basket, the score increases.  
- ❤️ **Lives system:** Players get three lives before the game ends.  


🧩 How It Works
1. The face tracker detects the user’s face and attaches a virtual basket near the chin.
2. Apples are spawned from random positions above the screen.
3. Each time an apple enters the basket’s area, the score increases.
4. If an apple falls without being caught, one life is deducted.
5. After three missed apples, the game displays a “Game Over” message.
